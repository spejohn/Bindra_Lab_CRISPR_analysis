# Test Data for Analysis Pipeline Unit Tests

This directory contains test data files used by the unit tests for the analysis pipeline. The files are automatically generated by the tests using fixtures, and should be cleaned up after the tests run.

## Test Data Structure

- `output/`: Directory for test function output files
- Various mock files generated by fixtures:
  - Mock FASTQ files
  - Mock count tables
  - Mock sample sheets
  - Mock library files
  - Mock contrasts files
  - Mock design matrices

## Notes

- The data in these files is minimal and designed only for testing purposes
- Most files are automatically created by fixtures in the test files
- The `output/` directory is cleaned between test runs

## Running Tests

To run the tests, navigate to the repository root and run pytest:

```bash
cd analysis_pipeline
pytest tests/analysis -v
```
